	Rank: 35
	send(Message) : Yes

org.xbill.DNS.Lookup;
	Rank: 3
	setDefaultResolver(Resolver) : Yes	//Seems a static method
	setDefaultCache(Cache, DCLASS.IN) : No  //Seems a static method

org.xbill.DNS.Message;
	Rank: 10
	newQuery(Record) : Yes	
	getHeader() : Yes

org.xbill.DNS.MXRecord;
	Rank: 13

	NOERROR : Yes
	NXDOMAIN : Yes

org.xbill.DNS.Record;
	Rank: 1
	This is a parent class of MXRecord. No additional methods on this class are used.

org.xbill.DNS.Resolver;
	Rank: None
	This is a parent class of ExtendedResolver. 
	send(Message) : Yes, Although this method is invoked on the parent class type, usually we try to detect the runtime type of a class
			and hence detected as ExtendedResolver in this case.

org.xbill.DNS.RRset;
	Rank: 11
	rrs() : Yes	//Returns set of records contained in this set

org.xbill.DNS.ResolverConfig;
	Rank: 27
	getCurrentConfig() : Yes

org.xbill.DNS.SetResponse;
	Rank: 15
	isSuccessful() : Yes
	isNXDOMAIN() : Yes
	isNXRRSET() : Yes
	
org.xbill.DNS.TextParseException;
	Rank: 8
	No methods are invoked. This is only an exception thrown by "Name.fromString" method invocation

org.xbill.DNS.Type;
	Rank: 4
	No methods are invoked. Only two static variables of this class are used.
	MX : Yes
	CNAME : Yes

org.xbill.DNS.Zone;
