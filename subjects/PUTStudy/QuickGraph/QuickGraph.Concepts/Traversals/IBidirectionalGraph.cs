	/// The BidirectionalGraph concept refines IncidenceGraph and adds the 
	/// requirement for efficient access to the in-edges of each vertex.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// This concept is separated from IncidenceGraph because for directed 
	/// graphs efficient access to in-edges typically requires more storage 
	/// space, and many algorithms do not require access to in-edges. 
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// For undirected graphs this is not an issue, 
	/// since the InEdges and OutEdges functions are the same, 
	/// they both return the edges incident to the vertex. 
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The InEdges() function is required to be constant time. 
	/// The InDegree and Degree properties functions must be linear in the 
	/// number of in-edges (for directed graphs) or incident edges 
	/// (for undirected graphs).
