the first application of multi-implementation testing for finding security based bugs in input validators..


issues in testing of input validators-:

-: string...most of test generation tools cannot deals with strings..
-: even pex cannot deal with complex regular expressions so we refactor those
-: In multi-implementation testing all the implementations have the same requirements, however, validators have different formats.

Scenarios when our tool is useful

-:when you have your validator and and want to test it
-: when we collect validators and want to see which one satisfy requirement

Confidence about our test results
(path coverage : statement coverage)
How much regexs we simplified
the simplification changes the semantic of regex, but make sure the generated strings satisfy the original regex.
Guideline: manual bug identification
