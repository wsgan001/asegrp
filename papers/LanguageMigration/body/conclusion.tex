\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:colcusion} Although researchers have proposed many
approaches to help language migration. These approach achieves only
limited success as projects often use many APIs and mapping
relations of APIs are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we propose
an approach to mine mapping relations of APIs from existing
different versions of a project automatically. We conducted
experiments on our approach. The results show that our approach
mines various API mapping between Java and C\# and API mapping
improves existing language translators such as CSharpToJava.
