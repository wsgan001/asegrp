\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:colcusion} Mapping relations of APIs are quite useful to
language migration but are difficult to obtain due to various
factors. In this paper, we propose an approach to mine mapping
relations of APIs from existing different versions of a project
automatically. We conducted evaluations on our approach. The results
show that our approach mines various API mapping between Java and
C\#, and API mapping improves existing language translators such as
Java2CSharp.
