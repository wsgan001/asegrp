Mapping relations of APIs are quite useful for the translation
of projects from one language to another language, and
it is difficult to mine these mapping relations due to various
challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that mines mapping
relations of APIs from existing projects with multiple versions in
different languages. We conducted two evaluations to show the effectiveness
of our approach. The results show that our approach mines many API mapping
relations between Java and C\#, and these relations improve existing language
translation tools such as Java2CSharp.
