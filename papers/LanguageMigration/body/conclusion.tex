\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:colcusion} Mapping relations of APIs are quite useful to
language migration but are difficult to obtain due to various
factors. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mine mapping
relations of APIs from existing different versions of a project
automatically. We conducted two evaluations on our approach. The
results show that our approach mines various API mapping between
Java and C\#, and API mapping improves existing language translators
such as Java2CSharp.
