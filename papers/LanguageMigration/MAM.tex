\begin{abstract}
In the long history of programming languages, researchers and
practitioners created various languages such as C\# and Java. These
languages have their own benefits and thus coexist in various
projects. To develop projects in multiple languages, programmers
need various manipulations such as translating projects from one
language into other languages. Automating this translation process
can reduce substantial manual effort. However, it is  challenging to
map APIs of different languages correctly in such automation. In
this paper, we propose a novel approach that mines API mapping
automatically. For two languages, our approach needs a set of
projects with versions in the two languages. From each project, our
approach analyzes its two versions and mines API mapping of the two
languages based on API usages exhibited in the two versions. The
mined API mapping describes mapping relations of APIs in different
languages and thus aids language migration. Based on our approach,
we implemented a tool named MAM (\textbf{M}ining \textbf{A}PI
\textbf{M}apping) and conducted an evaluation of our approach based
on the tool. The results show that our approach mines various API
mapping between Java and C\# with reasonable accuracies. The results
also show that mined API mapping reduces 54.4\% compilation errors
in translated projects of the CSharp2Java tool as mined API mapping
contains mapping relations that do not exist in language migration
tools such as CSharp2Java.
