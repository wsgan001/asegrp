\begin{abstract}
Since the inception of programming languages, researchers and
practitioners developed various languages such as Java and C\#. To
address business requirements and to survive in competing markets,
companies often have to release different versions of their projects
in different languages. Migrating projects from one language to
another language (such as from Java to C\#) manually is a tedious
and error-prone task. To reduce manual effort or human errors, tools
can be developed for automatic translation of projects from one
language to another, but these tools require the knowledge of how
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of one language are mapped
to the APIs of the other language, referred to as API mapping
relations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that mines API
mapping relations from one language to another using API client
code, referred to as MAM (\textbf{M}ining \textbf{A}PI
\textbf{M}apping). MAM accepts a set of projects with versions in
two languages and mines API mapping relations between those two
languages based on how APIs are used by the two versions. These
mined API mapping relations assist in translation of projects from
one language to another. For MAM, we implemented a tool and
conducted two evaluations to show the effectiveness of MAM. The
results show that our tool mines 25,805 unique mapping relations of
APIs between Java and C\# with more than 80\% accuracy. The results
also show that mined API mapping relations reduce 54.4\% compilation
errors and 43.0\% defects during translation of projects with an
existing translation tool, called Java2CSharp. The reduction in
compilation errors and defects is due to our new mined mapping
relations that are not available with the existing translation
tools.
