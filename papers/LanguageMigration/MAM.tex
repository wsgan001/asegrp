\begin{abstract}
Since the inception of programming languages, researchers and
practitioners developed various languages such as Java and C\#. To
address business requirements and to survive in competing markets,
companies often have to release different versions of their projects
in different languages. Migrating projects from one language to
another language (such as from Java to C\#) manually is a tedious
and error-prone task. In contrast, automatic translation of projects
from one language to another requires the knowledge of how
Application Programming Interfaces (API) of one language are mapped
to the APIs of the other language, referred as API mapping relations. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach that mines API mapping relations from one language to another using API client
code. Our approach accepts a set of projects with versions in two
languages and mines API mapping relations between those two languages based on how APIs are used
by the two versions. These mined API mappings assist in
translation of projects from one language to another. Based on our
approach, we implemented a tool, called MAM (\textbf{M}ining
\textbf{A}PI \textbf{M}apping), and conducted two evaluations to
show the effectiveness of our approach. The results show that our
approach mines 25,805 mapping relations of APIs between Java and C\#
with more than 80\% accuracy. The results also show that mined API
mapping relations reduce 54.4\% compilation errors during translation
of projects with an existing translation tool, called Java2CSharp. 
The reduction in compilation errors is due to our mined mappings
that do not available with the existing translation tools.
