\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

To exploit code search engines for several tasks that can help
improve the productivity of programmers, we developed an extensible
framework that helps to use the strength of code search engines and
addresses the major limitations in using CSEs for those tasks. Our
framework includes several heuristics to deal with partial code
samples returned by CSEs. We showed the effectiveness of our
framework with two tools developed based on our framework. In future
work, we plan to extend our framework for detecting bugs by mining
specification patterns from the code samples returned by CSEs. As
the current implementation is dependent on the code samples gathered
through GCSE, we plan to extend our framework to collect samples
from other CSEs like Krugle and Koders to analyze results across
different CSEs.
