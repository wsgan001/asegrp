Abstract:
Code Search Engines (CSE) can be used for several applications like searching
relevant code samples, identifying hotspots, and finding bugs. However, there
are two major limitations: returned samples are too many and they are partial
and not-compilable. Our framework addresses the preceding limitations and
helps exploiting CSEs for those applications.

Keywords:
Code reuse, Code search engine, Code examples, Framework hotspots
