{\Large{\bf Improving Web-Application Security via Automated Testing and Runtime Monitoring}}\\*[3mm]
\end{center}

The three major goals of security testing for web applications are \emph{confidentiality}, \emph{integrity}, and \emph{availability} (CIA). In this proposal, we primarily focus on the goals \emph{confidentiality} and \emph{availability}. The major objective of confidentiality is to secure web application from both known and unknown attacks. To achieve the confidentiality goal, we propose automatic testing and runtime monitoring specifically tailored for web applications to verify against known and unknown attacks, respectively. To achieve the availability goal, we ensure that the runtime monitoring has as low overhead as possible.
