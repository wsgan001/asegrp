\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have developed PARSEWeb, an approach for addressing problems
faced by programmers in reusing existing frameworks or libraries.
Our approach accepts queries of the form ``\emph{Source}
$\rightarrow$ \emph{Destination}'' as input and suggests
method-invocation sequences that can take the \emph{Source} object
type as input and result in the \emph{Destination} object type. Our
approach collects the relevant code samples, which include
\emph{Source} and \emph{Destination} object types, on demand from CSE.
This new idea of collecting sources on demand makes our approach 
independent of any specific set of
frameworks or libraries. Our approach includes several heuristics to
deal with partial and non-compilable code downloaded from CSE. Our 
query splitting heuristic addresses the problem of lack of
code samples by splitting the given query into multiple sub-queries.
We have conducted four different evaluations on our
approach. Through these evaluations, we showed that our approach is effective
in addressing the issues faced by programmers and performed
better than existing related tools.
