\section {Conclusion}
\label {sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed an approach called SpotWeb that 
assists software developers in reusing API classes and methods of an existing framework
by detecting hotspots and coldspots of the framework. \Comment{Hotspots can serve
as starting points for reusing the framework, whereas coldspots serve as caveats as there can 
be difficulties in finding related code examples.}
SpotWeb addresses major problems faced by previous 
related approaches by not requiring any additional efforts
from the developers and by collecting relevant code examples through
a code search engine. \Fix{In our evaluation, we found that often classes
of existing frameworks are either reused heavily or never reused.}
We also showed that the detected hotspots are 
indeed useful in helping effective framework reuse 
and showed that SpotWeb performs better than the earlier related
approach. In future work, we plan to explore other applications
of hotspots such as prioritization of bug reports based on hotspots.
