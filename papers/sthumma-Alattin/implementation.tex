TODO: Mention here that some of the components from the earlier
paper ASE07 are reused like CodeDownloader, CodeAnalyzer. Also mention
that the previous CodeAnalyzer just analyzes only those statements
that transform one object type to another. Now it has been extended
to handle many other kinds of statements in the Java programming language.
