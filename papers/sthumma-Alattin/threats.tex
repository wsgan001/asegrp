\section{Threats to Validity}
\label{sec:threats}
The threats to external validity primarily include the degree to which the subject programs and used CSE are representative of true practice. The current subjects range from small-scale libraries such as Java SQL APIs to large-scale libraries such as BCEL and Hibernate. We used only one CSE, i.e., Google code search, which is a well-known CSE. These threats could be reduced by more experiments on wider types of subjects and by using other CSEs in future work. The threats to internal validity are instrumentation effects that can bias our results. Faults in our Alattin prototype might cause such effects. There can be errors in our inspection of source code for confirming rules or defects. To reduce these threats, we inspected available specifications and also call sites in source code.
