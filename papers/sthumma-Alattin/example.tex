\section{Alattin Approach at a glance}
\label{sec:example}

We next use an example to describe how Alattin uses our ImMiner algorithm
to mine implicit programming rules in the form of balanced and imbalanced patterns.
We also explain how Alattin applies these mined programming rules to detect neglected conditions
and how imbalanced patterns can help reduce false warnings among detected violations.
Consider that an application under analysis uses the \CodeIn{Iterator.next} method as shown in the \CodeIn{printEntries2} method in Figure~\ref{fig:introexample}. 

Initially, Alattin collects relevant code examples of invoking the \CodeIn{Iterator.next}
method by constructing queries to Google code search. These relevant code examples
are required for mining patterns that describe necessary 
condition checks that should be done around the \CodeIn{Iterator.next} method.
Figure~\ref{fig:csecodeexample} shows a code example gathered from Google code search.
Alattin constructs a control-flow graph (CFG) for the code example
and performs two traversals (backward and forward) of the CFG
from the node corresponding to the \CodeIn{Iterator.next} method. In the backward traversal,
Alattin collects the condition checks on the receiver and 
argument objects preceding the call site of the \CodeIn{Iterator.next} method.
Similarly, in the forward traversal, Alattin collects
the condition checks on the receiver and return objects 
succeeding the call site of the \CodeIn{Iterator.next} method.
For the current code example, our backward and forward traversals gather
the following condition checks.

\begin{CodeOut}
\begin{alltt}
\hspace*{0.1in}1: boolean-check on return of Iterator.hasNext 
\hspace*{0.5in}before Iterator.next 
\hspace*{0.1in}2: boolean-check on return of Collection.isEmpty 
\hspace*{0.5in}before Iterator.next 
\hspace*{0.1in}3: instance-check on return after Iterator.next 
\hspace*{0.5in}with org.w3c.dom.Node
\end{alltt}
\end{CodeOut}

The preceding set of condition checks collected from the code example forms a pattern candidate
in $ISD$ for mining. In the preceding pattern candidate, backward traversal
produces condition checks 1 and 2, whereas the forward traversal produces 
condition check 3. Alattin analyzes all collected
code examples to generate various pattern candidates and applies ImMiner
to mine balanced and imbalanced patterns. Initially, ImMiner
computes frequent patterns using frequent itemset mining.
A frequent pattern mined by ImMiner is ``$P_1$: \CodeIn{boolean-check} on \CodeIn{return}
of \CodeIn{Iterator.hasNext} before \CodeIn{Iterator.next}''.
ImMiner next identifies all pattern candidates that do not support 
$P_1$ and computes frequent patterns among the non-supporting pattern candidates. 
The second phase generates alternative patterns such as
``$P_2$: \CodeIn{boolean-check} on \CodeIn{return}
of \CodeIn{ArrayList.size} before \CodeIn{Iterator.next}'',
resulting in an imbalanced pattern of the form ``$P_1$ \textbf{or} $\hat{P_2}$''.

Alattin next applies the mined pattern on the application under analysis 
to detect neglected conditions. Alattin does not report any 
violations if the application under analysis includes at least
one alternative of the mined pattern. For example, as the 
\CodeIn{printEntries2} method includes $P_2$, Alattin does not report
any violation in this code example. In contrast, existing 
approaches would report a violation leading to a false positive.

This example motivates the idea of 
exploiting a CSE for gathering relevant code examples
and applying analysis techniques to capture implicit programming rules. 
However, there are many other issues that are not obvious
in this illustrative example, as described next. 
(1) How do we exploit program dependencies in the source code to generate pattern candidates?
(2) How do we represent the pattern candidates extracted from code examples suitable for
applying the mining algorithm?
(3) How do we apply our mining algorithm on pattern candidates of different API
methods where pattern candidates of one API method (that is often used) can dominate the
pattern candidates of another API method (that is rarely used)? 
We address these issues in Section~\ref{sec:framework}, where we present key aspects
of our Alattin approach.
