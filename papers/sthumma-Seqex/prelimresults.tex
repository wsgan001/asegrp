\section{Preliminary Evaluation}
\label{sec:prelims}

We next present the preliminary results gathered by minually using the information from our approach. We use examples
from four real-world applications to show the preliminary results of our feasibility study. Column ``Before'' shows the block coverage achieved by Pex without the assistance from our approach. Column ``After'' shows the block coverage achieved after the assistance from the approach. The results show that Pex achieves better code coverages with the assistance of our approach.
