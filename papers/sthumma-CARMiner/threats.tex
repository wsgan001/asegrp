\section{Threats to Validity}
\label{sec:threats}
The threats to external validity primarily include the degree
to which the subject applications and CSE used are representative of true practice. 
The current subjects range from small-scale applications such as Axion
to large-scale applications such as Ptolemy. We used
only one CSE, i.e., Google code search, which is a well-known CSE. These threats could
be reduced by more experiments on wider types of subjects and by using
other CSEs in future work. The threats to external validity also
include the quality of code examples collected from a CSE. We tried to 
reduce this threat to some extent by capturing most frequent patterns among
these code examples. The threats to internal validity are
instrumentation effects that can bias our results. Faults in
our CAR-Miner prototype might cause such effects. There can be errors
in our inspection of source code for confirming defects. To reduce these
threats, we inspected available related specifications and call sites
in source code.
