\begin{abstract}\vspace*{-1ex}
Programming languages such as Java and C++ provide exception-handling 
constructs to handle exception conditions.
Applications are expected to handle these exception conditions and take necessary recovery
actions such as releasing opened database connections. 
However, exception-handling rules that describe these necessary recovery actions
are often not available in practice. To address this issue, we develop a novel 
approach that mines exception-handling rules as sequence association rules 
of the form ``($FC_c^1$...$FC_c^n$) $\wedge$ $FC_a$ $\Rightarrow$ ($FC_e^1$...$FC_e^m$)''.
This rule describes that function call $FC_a$ should be followed by a sequence of 
function calls ($FC_e^1$...$FC_e^m$) when $FC_a$ is preceded by a sequence of function calls
($FC_c^1$...$FC_c^n$). Such form of rules is required to characterize common exception-handling rules.
We show the usefulness of these mined rules by applying them on five real-world applications (including $285$ KLOC)
to detect violations in our evaluation.
Our empirical results show that our approach mines $294$ real exception-handling
rules in these five applications  and 
also detects $160$ defects, where $87$ defects are new defects that are not found by a previous related approach.
