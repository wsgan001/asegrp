We have developed an approach, called CAR-Miner, that mines exception-handling 
rules in the form of sequence association rules. Unlike simple association
rules of the form ``$FC_a$ $\Rightarrow$ $FC_e$'', these sequence association rules
of the form ``($FC_c^1$...$FC_c^n$) $\wedge$ $FC_a$ $\Rightarrow$ ($FC_e^1$...$FC_e^m$)''
can characterize more complex exception-handling rules. As existing
mining algorithms cannot mine these sequence association rules, we proposed a novel mining
algorithm based on frequent closed subsequence mining. CAR-Miner
also tries to address the problems of limited data scopes faced 
by existing approaches by expanding the data scope to open source projects available on the web.
We have evaluated our approach with five real-world open source applications
and shown that CAR-Miner mined $294$ real exception-handling rules. 
We have also shown that CAR-Miner finds $160$ defects, where $87$ are new defects,
not being found by a previous related approach~\cite{WeimerN05}. 
Our approach takes a step forward in the direction 
of developing new mining algorithms to address
unique requirements in mining software engineering data, beyond being limited
by existing off-the-shelf mining algorithms.
