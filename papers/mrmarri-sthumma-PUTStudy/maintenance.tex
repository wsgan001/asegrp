\subsection{Maintenance of Test Code}

We next address the third research question of whether PUTs reduce the efforts for the
maintenance of test code. We address this question by counting the number of CUTs and
the number of PUTs generalized from CUTs. We also calculate the lines of code of CUTs
and PUTs.
