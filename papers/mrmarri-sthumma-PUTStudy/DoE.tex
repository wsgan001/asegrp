\section{Design of Empirical Study}

We conduct an empirical study using three real world applications to study the benefits of Parameterized Unit Tests (PUT) over Conventional Unit Tests (CUT). 
In our empirical study, we show the benefits of PUTs over existing CUTs in terms of three factors: code coverage, defects, and complexity of test code. 
In particular, we address the following three research questions through our empirical study:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{RQ1.} How much higher percentage of code coverage is achieved by PUTs compared to existing CUTs? Since PUTs are a generalized form of CUTs, this research question helps to address whether PUTs can achieve additional coverage compared to CUTs.
	\item \textbf{RQ2.} How many new defects (that are not detected by CUTs) are detected by PUTs and vice-versa? This research question helps to address whether PUTs have more fault-detection capabilities compared to CUTs.
	\item \textbf{RQ3.} How many number of tests are reduced by generalizing CUTs to PUTs? This research question helps to address whether PUTs require lesser efforts for maintaining test code compared to CUTs.
\end{itemize}
