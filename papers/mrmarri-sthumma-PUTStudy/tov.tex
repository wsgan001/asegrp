\section{Threats to validity}
\label{sec:tov}
\vspace*{2ex}
The threats to external validity primarily include the degree to which the subject programs, faults, and conventional unit tests are representative of true practice. The number of classes used in our empirical study is relatively small, although the defects detected during our study are real defects. These threats could be reduced by conducting more studies with wider types of subjects in our future work. The threats to internal validity are due to manual process involved in writing PUTs. Our study results can be biased based on our experience and knowledge of the subject programs. These threats can be reduced by conducting more case studies with more subject programs and other human subjects. The results in our study can also vary based on other factors such as the effectiveness of our written PUTs and test generation capability of Pex. One threat to construct validity is that our study uses the block coverage reports generated by Pex to reflect the quality of tests.
