\section{Threats to validity}
\label{sec:tov}

The threats to external validity primarily include the degree to which the subject programs, defects, and CUTs are representative of true practice. The subject applications used in our empirical study range from small-scale to medium-scale applications that are widely used in the software industry as shown by their number of downloads. We tried to alleviate the threats related to detected defects by inspecting the source code and by reporting the defects to the developers of the application under test. These threats could further be reduced by conducting more studies with wider types of subjects in our future work. The threats to internal validity are due to manual process involved in transforming CUTs to PUTs. Our study results can be biased based on our experience and knowledge of the subject applications. These threats can be reduced by conducting more case studies with more subject applications and other human subjects. The results in our study can also vary based on other factors such as the effectiveness of transformed PUTs and test-generation capability of Pex.
