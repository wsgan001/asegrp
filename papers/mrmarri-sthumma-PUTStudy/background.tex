We use Pex~\cite{pex:rel} as an example state-of-the-art DSE-based test generation tool for generating CUTs using PUTs. Pex is a white-box test generation tool for .NET programs. Parts of Pex may be integrated into a future version of Microsoft Visual Studio, benefiting an enormous number of developers in industry. Pex accepts PUTs and symbolically executes the PUTs and the code under test to generate a set of CUTs that can achieve high coverage of the code under test~\cite{king:symex}. Pex has been widely used both in academia and industry, which is reflected by its download counts (Feb. 2008 - Oct. 2009) that are greater than $17000$ and $13000$, respectively. Pex is applied on industrial code bases and detected serious defects in a software component, which had already been extensively tested~\cite{tillmann08:pex}.
