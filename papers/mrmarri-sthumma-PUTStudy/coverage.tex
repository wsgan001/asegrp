\subsection{Coverage}

We next describe our design of metric collection for answering our RQ1. We execute the existing test suite (CUTs) and measure the coverage achieved for each class under test. We then execute the PUTs, i.e., the generalized CUTs and measure the coverage achieved for each class under test by these PUTs. We then compare the code coverage achieved by both the existing test suite and the generalized test suite. We use the Pex coverage report to measure the dynamic coverage achieved by the test suites.
