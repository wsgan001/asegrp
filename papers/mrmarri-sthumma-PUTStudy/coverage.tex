\subsection{Coverage}

We next describe our design of our experiment for addressing RQ1. We execute the existing test suite (CUTs) and measure the coverage achieved for each class under test. We then execute the PUTs, i.e., the generalized CUTs and measure the coverage achieved for each class under test by these PUTs. We then compare the code coverage achieved by both CUTs and PUTs for each class under test. We use the Pex coverage report to measure the dynamic coverage achieved by both CUTs and PUTs.
