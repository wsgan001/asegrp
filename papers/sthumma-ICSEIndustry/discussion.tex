\section{Discussion and Future Work}
\label{sec:discussion}

Although our generated tests achieved higher coverage (24.3\%) than the seed tests, the overall coverage
is still not close to 100\% coverage. There are two main issues for not achieving coverage
close to 100\%. First, our recorded dynamic traces do not cover all public methods of the libraries under analyses.
In future work, we plan to address this issue by generating PUTs for all uncovered public methods. Second,
the code under test includes a few branches that cannot be covered with the test scenarios recorded
during program executions. To address this issue, we plan to generate new test scenarios
from existing scenarios by using evolutionary techniques~\cite{tonella:etoc}.

Although regression testing is our ultimate goal, in our current approach, we primarily focused on 
generating high-covering regression tests for a given version of software. In future work, we plan to 
execute these regression tests on new versions for detecting regression faults.
