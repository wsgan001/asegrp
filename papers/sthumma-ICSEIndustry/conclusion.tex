Regression testing is an important and yet challenging problem in the
field of software maintenance. The quality of regression tests is based on
the test scenarios (in the form of method-call sequences) used in the tests.
Unlike existing approaches that generate test scenarios randomly, in this paper,
we proposed a novel scalable approach that generates test scenarios via mining dynamic
traces recorded during program execution. In our approach, we transform these generated
test scenarios into PUTs and use dynamic symbolic execution to generate regression
tests that achieve a high coverage of the code under test. In our evaluations,
we show that our approach recorded $\approx$ 1.5GB of dynamic traces and 
generated $\approx$ 500,000 regression tests on two core .NET 2.0 framework libraries. 
These numbers show that our approach is highly scalable and can be used in practice to deal 
with large real-world applications. In future work, we plan to generate new test scenarios
via combining generated test scenarios using evolutionary strategies.
