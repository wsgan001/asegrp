Since the inception of programming languages, researchers and practitioners developed various languages such as Java and C\#. To address business requirements and to survive in competing markets,
companies often have to release different versions of their projects in different languages. Migrating projects from one language to another language (such as from Java to C\#) manually is a tedious
and error-prone task. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called MAM (\textbf{M}ining \textbf{A}PI
\textbf{M}apping), that mines API mapping relations from one language to another using API client code. 
These mined API mapping relations assist in automatic migration of projects from one language to another. We conducted two evaluations to show the effectiveness
of our approach. The results show that our approach mines many API mapping relations between Java and C\#, and these relations improve existing language migration tools such as Java2CSharp.
