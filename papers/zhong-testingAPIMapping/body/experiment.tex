\section{Evaluations}
\label{sec:evaluation}

We implemented a tool for TeMaAPI and
conducted two evaluations using our tool to show the effectiveness
of our approach. In our evaluations, we address the following
two research questions:

%\vspace*{-1.5ex}
\begin{enumerate}
\item How effectively can our approach detect different behaviors of API mapping relations for migration tools that translate code from Java to CSharp(Section~\ref{sec:evaluation:java2csharp})? \vspace*{-1.8ex}
\item How effectively can our approach detect different behaviors of API mapping relations for migration tools that translate code from CSharp to Java (Section~\ref{sec:evaluation:csharp2java})? %\vspace*{-1.8ex}
\end{enumerate}%\vspace*{-1.5ex}

In our evaluations, we introduce Java2CSharp and C\# to Java converter\footnote{\url{http://tinyurl.com/24o6jpc}} as subjects. We choose Java2Charp since it is a relatively mature tool developed by ILOG\footnote{\url{http://www.ilog.com/}} (now part of IBM). We choose C\# to Java converter since it is a commercial tool developed by Tangible Software\footnote{\url{http://www.tangiblesoftwaresolutions.com}}.
