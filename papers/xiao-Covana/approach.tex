\subsection{Approach Overview}
Our approach takes the coverage data and reported issues as input and outputs the non-covered branches with the associated issues. Figure 1 shows the high level design of Covana. Covana consists of three major components: observer component, pre-processing component and analysis component.
\\The observer is implemented as several Pex extension and is attached to Pex for observing different events and collecting data. It collects the coverage data and reported issues and passed them to the pre-processing component. The pre-processing component remove the useless data and dump the data into binary files. The analysis component consumes the pre-processed data in files, carrys out the analysis on the data and outputs the relevant data for non-covered issues.
